## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the StoreOps project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/niranjangirhe/storeops-admin-portal.git
```

2. Install dependencies (Node.js version 20 is recommended):

```
npm i
```

3. Set up environment variables as per the sample.env file.

4. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Ensure you have access to all necessary services and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

## Additional Requirements

- Clerk account for authentication
- Stripe account for payment processing
- Cloudinary account for image hosting
- MySQL database

Make sure you have accounts set up with these services and have obtained the necessary API keys and credentials.

## API Usage

The admin portal provides APIs that can be used by the storefront or other applications. The base URL for API requests is:

```
https://your-admin-portal-domain.com/api/{storeId}
```

Replace 'admin-portal-domain' with the actual domain where your admin portal is hosted. The `{storeId}` parameter is the ID of the specific store you want to interact with.

If you are using the StoreOps sample frontend UI, add the following to your frontend .env file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://admin-portal-domain/api/{storeId}
```

### Available API Endpoints

- Billboards: `/api/{storeId}/billboards`
- Categories: `/api/{storeId}/categories`
- Sizes: `/api/{storeId}/sizes`
- Colors: `/api/{storeId}/colors`
- Products: `/api/{storeId}/products`
